# 1.1 Getting Started with Python 🐍

It's pretty easy to start with Python Language 🐍.
We would be using Python >= 3.9 in this [Repository](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/PythonWorkshop) as of now 🙂

1.   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
2.   Pull the docker image [naveen8/pythonworkshop](https://hub.docker.com/r/naveen8/pythonworkshop) or build a Docker image by using the Dockerfile present in our [Repository](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/PythonWorkshop) and run the container out of it which comes bundled with everything to run the code present in our repository 🚀.

Lets check the version of Python we are using.
We have 2 ways to know this.


1.   Open the cmd or terminal and execute **python --version**
2.   Using Python's builtin sys module


```python
import sys

print(sys.version)
```

    3.9.5 (default, May 12 2021, 15:26:36) 
    [GCC 8.3.0]
