# 1.10 String representations of objects: str() vs repr()

`str()` and `repr()` are builtin functions used to represent the object
in the form of string.

Suppose we have an object `x`.

`str(x)` would be calling the dunder (double underscore) `__str__`
method of `x` as `x.__str__()`

`repr(x)` would be calling the dunder (double underscore) `__repr__`
method of `x` as `x.__repr__()`

ðŸ˜‘ Well, what all are these new terms `__str__` and `__repr__` ðŸ¤”?

As we know that Python is object oriented language, and so supports
inheritance. In Python, all the classes would inherit from the base
class `object`. `object` class has the methods `__str__`, `__repr__` and
a lot more (which can be deepdived in someother notebook ðŸ˜‰). Hence every
class would be having `__str__` and `__repr__` implicitly ðŸ˜Š

Pythonâ€™s official documentations states that `__str__` should be used to
represent a object which is human readable(informal), whereas `__repr__`
is used for official representation of an object.

``` python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()

print(f"The repr of now is: {repr(now)}")
print(f"The str of now is: {str(now)}")
```

    The repr of now is: datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 6, 4, 11, 4, 520866)
    The str of now is: 2021-06-06 04:11:04.520866

``` python
class ProgrammingLanguage:
    def __init__(self, language: str):
        self.language = language


language_obj = ProgrammingLanguage(language="Python")
print(f"The repr of language_obj is: {repr(language_obj)}")
print(f"The str of language_obj is: {str(language_obj)}")
```

    The repr of language_obj is: <__main__.ProgrammingLanguage object at 0x7f080861d9d0>
    The str of language_obj is: <__main__.ProgrammingLanguage object at 0x7f080861d9d0>

In the above example we see that default repr output. The address of the
object might be different for everyone.

Now letâ€™s try to override the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and see
how the representations work

``` python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # overriding __str__ method
    def __str__(self):
        return f"I am {self.name} of age {self.age}"

    # overriding __repr__ method
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Human(name={self.name}, age={self.age}) object at {hex(id(self))}"


human_obj = Human(name="IronMan", age=48)
print(f"The repr of human_obj is: {repr(human_obj)}")
print(f"The str of human_obj is: {str(human_obj)}")
```

    The repr of human_obj is: Human(name=IronMan, age=48) object at 0x7f08085da040
    The str of human_obj is: I am IronMan of age 48

We see that the result representations of the `human_obj` have been
changed as we have overridden the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods ðŸ˜Š
