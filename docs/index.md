# 1.1 Getting Started with Python üêç

It‚Äôs pretty easy to start with Python Language üêç. We would be using
Python \>= 3.9 in this
[Repository](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/PythonWorkshop) as of
now üôÇ

1.  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
2.  Pull the docker image
    [naveen8/pythonworkshop](https://hub.docker.com/r/naveen8/pythonworkshop)
    or build a Docker image by using the Dockerfile present in our
    [Repository](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/PythonWorkshop)
    and run the container out of it which comes bundled with everything
    to run the code present in our repository üöÄ.

Lets check the version of Python we are using. We have 2 ways to know
this.

1.  Open the cmd or terminal and execute **python ‚Äìversion**
2.  Using Python‚Äôs builtin sys module

<!-- end list -->

``` python
import sys

print(sys.version)
```

    3.9.5 (default, May 12 2021, 15:26:36) 
    [GCC 8.3.0]

# 1.2 Creating variables and assigning values

Python is a Dynamically typed language. It means based on the value we
assign to a variable, it sets the datatype to it.

Now the question is ‚ÄúHow do we assign a value to a variable?ü§î‚Äù. It‚Äôs
pretty easy.

``` python
<variable_name> = <value>
```

We have a big list of data types that come as builtins in Python.

  - None
  - bytes
  - int
  - bool
  - float
  - complex
  - string
  - tuple
  - list
  - set
  - dict

Apart from the above prominent data types, we have a few other data
types like namedtuple, frozensets, etc..

Let‚Äôs create examples for the above data types, will be little bored in
just seeing the examples. We would be covering in depth about these data
types in upcoming chapters :)

Few things to know before getting into the examples:üòâ

1.  `print` function is used to print the data on to the console. We
    used `f` inside the print function which is used to format the
    strings as `{}`, these are known as f-strings.
2.  `type` function is used to find the type of the object or datatype.

<!-- end list -->

``` python
# None
none_datatype = None
print(f"The type of none_datatype is {type(none_datatype)}")
```

    The type of none_datatype is <class 'NoneType'>

``` python
# int
int_datatype = 13
print(f"The type of int_datatype is {type(int_datatype)}")
```

    The type of int_datatype is <class 'int'>

``` python
# bytes
bytes_datatype = b"Hello Python!"
print(f"The type of bytes_datatype is {type(bytes_datatype)}")
```

    The type of bytes_datatype is <class 'bytes'>

``` python
# bool
# bool datatype can only have either True or False. Integer value of True is 1 and False is 0.
bool_datatype = True
print(f"The type of bool_datatype is {type(bool_datatype)}")
```

    The type of bool_datatype is <class 'bool'>

``` python
# float
float_datatype = 3.14
print(f"The type of float_datatype is {type(float_datatype)}")
```

    The type of float_datatype is <class 'float'>

``` python
# complex
complex_datatype = 13 + 5j
print(f"The type of complex_datatype is {type(complex_datatype)}")
```

    The type of complex_datatype is <class 'complex'>

``` python
# str
str_datatype = "Hey! Welcome to Python."
print(f"The type of str_datatype is {type(str_datatype)}")
```

    The type of str_datatype is <class 'str'>

``` python
# tuple
tuple_datatype = (None, 13, True, 3.14, "Hey! Welcome to Python.")
print(f"The type of tuple_datatype is {type(tuple_datatype)}")
```

    The type of tuple_datatype is <class 'tuple'>

``` python
# list
list_datatype = [None, 13, True, 3.14, "Hey! Welcome to Python."]
print(f"The type of list_datatype is {type(list_datatype)}")
```

    The type of list_datatype is <class 'list'>

``` python
# set
set_datatype = {None, 13, True, 3.14, "Hey! Welcome to Python."}
print(f"The type of set_datatype is {type(set_datatype)}")
```

    The type of set_datatype is <class 'set'>

``` python
# dict
dict_datatype = {
    "language": "Python",
    "Inventor": "Guido Van Rossum",
    "release_year": 1991,
}
print(f"The type of dict_datatype is {type(dict_datatype)}")
```

    The type of dict_datatype is <class 'dict'>

## Tidbits

The thing which I Love the most about Python is the dynamic typing, Due
to this we might not know what are the types of parameters we might pass
to a function or method. If you pass any other type of object as a
parameter, **boom** you might see Exceptions raised during the runtimeüëª.
Let‚Äôs remember that **With great power comes great responsibility** üï∑

To help the developers with this, from Python 3.6 we have [Type
Hints(PEP-484)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).

We will get through these in the coming chapters. Stay tuned
üòá

# 1.3 Python Keywords and allowed Variable names

``` python
# To retrieve the python keyword list, we can use the keyword built-in package.
import keyword
```

Let‚Äôs print the keywords present.

keyword.kwlist returns python‚Äôs keywords in a list datatype.

We are using \*(starred) expression to print the values returned by
keyword.kwlist each separated by ‚Äú‚Äù(newline).

``` python
print(*keyword.kwlist, sep="\n")
```

    False
    None
    True
    __peg_parser__
    and
    as
    assert
    async
    await
    break
    class
    continue
    def
    del
    elif
    else
    except
    finally
    for
    from
    global
    if
    import
    in
    is
    lambda
    nonlocal
    not
    or
    pass
    raise
    return
    try
    while
    with
    yield

## Variable Names

TLDR:

  - Variable names shouldn‚Äôt be same as that of built-in keywords.
  - Variable name shouldn‚Äôt start with a number or with a symbol(except
    ‚Äú\_‚Äù, protected and private attributes are created using
    underscore, ü§î it‚Äôs better to say it as name mangling rather than
    protected or private. That‚Äôs for a different notebook session üòÄ).

PS: Don‚Äôt give a try naming the variable that starts with \#, it would
be a Python‚Äôs comment, which would be neglected by the interpreter üòÖ.

### Allowed Variable names

``` python
x = True
_x = False
x_y = "Hey Python geek!"
x9 = "alphabet_number"
# Python is a case sensitive language, so `x` is different from `X`. Let's give it a try.
X = "one more variable"
print(f"x is equal to X:{x==X}")
```

    x is equal to X:False

### Invalid Variable names

We will be using `exec` within `try`-`except` to catch the syntax error.
ü§î But why? Syntax errors can‚Äôt be catched, well it shouldn‚Äôt for good üòâ.
so we are using `exec` to execute the code.

`exec` takes the string argument and interprets the string as a python
code.

``` python
# variable name starting with number.
code_string = "9x=True"
try:
    exec(code_string)
except SyntaxError as exc:
    print(f"Ouch! In the exception: {exc}")
```

    Ouch! In the exception: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)

``` python
# variable name starting with a symbol(other than underscore"_").
code_string = "$g = 10"
try:
    exec(code_string)
except SyntaxError as exc:
    print(f"Ouch! In the exception: {exc}")
```

    Ouch! In the exception: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)

# 1.4 Data types

`Kiddo explanation üòá:`

We might use many materials like sand, bricks, concrete to construct a
house. These are basic and essential needs to have the construction done
and each of them have a specific role or usage.

Likewise, we need various data types like string, boolean, integer,
dictionary etc.. for the development of a code. We need to know where to
use a specific data type and it‚Äôs functionality.üòä

We have various built-in data types that come out of the box üòé.

| Data type  | Mutable? |
| ---------- | -------- |
| None       | ‚ùå        |
| bytes      | ‚ùå        |
| bool       | ‚ùå        |
| int        | ‚ùå        |
| float      | ‚ùå        |
| complex    | ‚ùå        |
| str        | ‚ùå        |
| tuple      | ‚ùå        |
| list       | ‚úÖ        |
| set        | ‚úÖ        |
| dictionary | ‚úÖ        |

The First question we would be interested in is ‚ÄúWhat is Mutable?ü§î‚Äù. If
a object can be altered after its creation, then it is Mutable, else
Immutable.

### **None**

None is a singleton object, which represents empty or null.

#### *Example of None usage*:

In this example, Let‚Äôs try getting the environment variables üòâ

We would be using the `os` module‚Äôs `getenv` method to fetch the
environment variable‚Äôs value, if there isn‚Äôt that environment variable,
it would be returning `None`

``` python
import os

# let's set a env variable first
new_environment_variable_name: str = input("Enter the variable name: \n>>>")
new_environment_variable_value: str = input("Enter the variable's value: \n>>>")
os.environ[new_environment_variable_name] = new_environment_variable_value

# Now let's try to fetch a envrionment's variable value
env_variable_name: str = input("Enter the variable name to be searched: \n>>>")
value = os.getenv(env_variable_name)
if value is None:
    print(f"There is no environment variable named {env_variable_name}")
else:
    print(
        f"The value assigned for the environment variable named {env_variable_name} is {value}"
    )
```

    Enter the variable name: 
    >>> Language
    Enter the variable's value: 
    >>> Python
    Enter the variable name to be searched: 
    >>> Golang
    
    
    There is no environment variable named Golang

### **bytes**

byte objects are the sequences of bytes, these are machine readable form
and can be stored on the disk. Based on the encoding format, the bytes
yield results.

bytes can be converted to string by decoding it, vice-versa is known as
encoding.

bytes objects can be created by prefixing `b` before the string.

``` python
bytes_obj: bytes = b"Hello Python Enthusiast!"
print(bytes_obj)
```

    b'Hello Python Enthusiast!'

We see that they are visually the same as string when printed. But
actually they are ASCII values, for the convenience of the developer, we
see them as human readable strings.

But how to see the actual representation of bytes object? ü§î It‚Äôs pretty
simple üòâ\! We can typecast the bytes object to a list and we see each
character as it‚Äôs respective ASCII
    value.

``` python
print(list(bytes_obj))
```

    [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 69, 110, 116, 104, 117, 115, 105, 97, 115, 116, 33]

### **bool**

bool objects have only two values: `True`‚úÖ and `False`‚ùå, integer
equivalent of True is 1 and for False is 0

``` python
do_we_love_python = True
if do_we_love_python:
    print("üêç Python too loves and takes care of you ‚ù§Ô∏è")
else:
    print("üêç Python still loves you ‚ù§Ô∏è")
```

    üêç Python too loves and takes care of you ‚ù§Ô∏è

PS: Boolean values in simple terms mean **Yes** for `True` and **No**
for `False`

### **int**

int objects are any mathematical Integers. pretty easy right üòé

``` python
# Integer values can be used for any integer arithmetics.
# A few simple operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc..
operand_1 = int(input("Enter an integer value: \n>>>"))
operand_2 = int(input("Enter an integer value: \n>>>"))
print(operand_1 + operand_2)
```

    Enter an integer value: 
    >>> 3
    Enter an integer value: 
    >>> 5
    
    
    8

### **float**

float objects are any rational numbers.

``` python
# Like integer objects float objects are used for decimal arithmetics
# A few simple operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc..
# We are typcasting integer or float value to float values explicitly.
operand_1 = float(input("Enter the integer/float value: \n>>>"))
operand_2 = float(input("Enter the integer/float value: \n>>>"))
print(operand_1 + operand_2)
```

    Enter the integer/float value: 
    >>> 1.2
    Enter the integer/float value: 
    >>> 2.3
    
    
    3.5

### **complex**

complex objects aren‚Äôt so complex to understand üòâ

complex objects hold a Real number and an imaginary number. While
creating the complex object, we would be having a `j` beside the
imaginary number.

``` python
operand_1 = 10 + 5j
operand_2 = 3 + 4j
print(operand_1 * operand_2)
```

    (10+55j)

explanation for the above math: üòâ

``` math
(3+4j)*(10+5j)
3(10+5j) + 4j(10+5j)
30 + 15j + 40j + 20(j*j)
30 + 15j + 40j + 20(-1)
30 + 15j + 40j - 20
30 - 20 + 15j + 40j
10 + 55j
```

### **str**

string objects hold an sequence of characters.

``` python
my_string = "üêç Python is cool"
print(my_string)
```

    üêç Python is cool

### **tuple**

tuple object is an immutable datatype which can have any datatype
objects inside it and is created by enclosing paranthesis `()` and
objects are separated by a comma.

Once the tuple object is created, the tuple can‚Äôt be modified, although
if the objects in the tuple are mutable, they can be changed üòä

The objects in the tuple are ordered, So the objects in the tuple can be
accessed by using its index ranging from 0 to (number of elements -
1).

``` python
# tuples are best suited for having data which doesn't change in it's lifetime.

apple_and_its_colour = ("apple", "red")
watermelon_and_its_colour = ("watermelon", "green")

language_initial_release_year = ("Golang", 2012)
language_initial_release_year = ("Angular", 2010)
language_initial_release_year = ("Python", 1990)

# We can't add new data types objects, delete the existing datatype objects, or change the values
# of the existing objects.

# We can get the values by index.
print(
    f"{language_initial_release_year[0]} is released in {language_initial_release_year[1]}"
)
```

    Python is released in 1990

### **list**

list objects are similar to tuple, the differences are the list object
is mutable, so we can add or remove objects in the list even after its
creation. It is created by using `[]`.

``` python
about_python = [
    "interpreted",
    "object-oriented",
    "dynamically typed",
    "open source",
    "high level language",
    "üêç",
    1990,
]
print(about_python)
# We can add more values to the above list. append method of list object is used to add a new object.
# let's give a try üôÉ

about_python.append("Guido Van Rossum")
print(about_python)
```

    ['interpreted', 'object-oriented', 'dynamically typed', 'open source', 'high level language', 'üêç', 1990]
    ['interpreted', 'object-oriented', 'dynamically typed', 'open source', 'high level language', 'üêç', 1990, 'Guido Van Rossum']

### **set**

set objects are unordered, unindexed, non repetitive collection of
objects. Mathematical set theory operations can be applied using set
datatype objects. üòä it is created by using `{}`.

PS: `{}` denotes a dictionary, we need to use `set()` for creating an
empty set, there won‚Äôt be this issue when creating set objects
containing objects, for example: `{1,"a"}`

set objects are good for having the mathematical set operations.

``` python
set_obj = {6, 4, 4, 3, 10, "Python", "Python", "Golang"}
# We see that we have created a set with 8 objects.
print(set_obj)
# But when printed, we see that only 6 are present because set doesn't allow same objects repeated.
```

    {'Golang', 3, 4, 6, 'Python', 10}

### **dict**

dictionary objects are used for creating key-value pairs, Here keys
would be unique while values can be repeated.

The object assigned to a key can be fetched by using `<dict_obj>[key]`
which raises a KeyError when no given key is found. The other way to
fetch is by using `<dict_obj>.get(key)` which returns `None` by default
if no key is found.

``` python
dict_datatype = {
    "language": "Python",
    "Inventor": "Guido Van Rossum",
    "release_year": 1991,
}
print(f"The programming language is: {dict_datatype['language']}")
# We could use get method to prevent KeyError if the given Key is not found.
result = dict_datatype.get("LatestRelease")
# Value of the result would be None as the key LatestRelease is not present in dict_datatype
print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

    The programming language is: Python
    The result is: None

# 1.5 Collection Types

We have many collection types in Python, `str`, `int` objects hold only
value, but coming to collection types, we can have various objects
stored in the collections.

The Collection Types we have in Python are: 
* Tuple 
* List 
* Set 
* Dictionary

## Tuple

A Tuple is a ordered collection of objects and it is of fixed length and
immutable, so the values in the tuple can not be changed nor added or
removed.

Tuples are generally used for small collections which we are sure about
them from right before such as IP addresses and port numbers. Tuples are
represented with paranthesis `()`

Example:

``` python
ip_address_port = ("127.0.0.1", 8080)
```

A tuple with a single member needs to have a trailing comma, else the
type of the variable would be the datatype of the member itself.

``` python
# Proper way to create a single member tuple.
single_member_tuple = ("one",)
print(type(single_member_tuple))
single_member_tuple = ("one",)
print(type(single_member_tuple))
```

    <class 'tuple'>
    <class 'tuple'>

``` python
# Improper way trying to create a single member tuple.
single_member_tuple = "one"
print(type(single_member_tuple))
```

    <class 'str'>

## List

List collection types are similar to tuples, the only difference would
be that new objects can be created, removed or object‚Äôs data can be
modified üòâ.

``` python
int_list = [1, 2, 3]
string_list = ["abc", "defghi"]
```

``` python
# A list can be empty:
empty_list = []
```

objects in the list are not restricted to be of a particular datatype.
let‚Äôs see an example üëá.

``` python
mixed_list = [1, "abc", True, 3.14, None]
```

list can contain lists as objects too. These are called nested lists.

``` python
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"]]
```

The objects present in the list can be accessed by the index it is
placed. The index starts from 0 üëª.

``` python
my_list = ["Iron man", "Thor", "Wonder Woman", "Wolverine", "Naruto"]
```

``` python
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[1])
```

    Iron man
    Thor

In the `my_list`, we have 5 strings in the list, but in the below
example, let‚Äôs give a try to get the 100th index element which is not
present in the `my_list` üôÑ.

As there is no 100th element, we would be seeing an `IndexError`
exception.

``` python
try:
    print(my_list[100])
except IndexError as exc:
    print(f"üëª Ouch! we got into IndexError exception: {exc}")
```

    üëª Ouch! we got into IndexError exception: list index out of range

The question I have is, how do I get the 2nd element from the last ü§î?
Should I find the length of the list and access the \<length - 2\>? Yup,
it works üòâ.

But we have one good way to do it by negative index, example: `-2`

``` python
# Access the 2nd element from the last.
print(my_list[-2])
```

    Wolverine

#### We have a few methods of list that we can give it a try now üòé

`append`

``` python
# Append a new item to the list.
# We use append method of the list.
my_list.append("Zoro")
print(my_list)
```

    ['Iron man', 'Thor', 'Wonder Woman', 'Wolverine', 'Naruto', 'Zoro']

`remove`

``` python
# Remove the item present in the list.
# We use remove method of the list.
# If there's no object that we are trying to remove in the list, then ValueError would be raised.
try:
    my_list.remove("Zoro")
    print(my_list)
except ValueError as exc:
    print(f"Caught ValueError: {exc}")
```

    ['Iron man', 'Thor', 'Wonder Woman', 'Wolverine', 'Naruto']

`insert`

``` python
# Insert a object at a particular index.
# We use insert method of the list.
my_list.insert(1, "Super Man")
print(my_list)
```

    ['Iron man', 'Super Man', 'Thor', 'Wonder Woman', 'Wolverine', 'Naruto']

`reverse`

``` python
# Reverse the objects in the list.
# we use reverse method of the list.
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)

# revert to the actual order
my_list.reverse()

# We have one more method too for this üôÉ
# The indexing of the list would be in the form of list[start: end: step]
# We will use step as -1 to get the elements in reverse order üòâ
print(my_list[::-1])
```

    ['Naruto', 'Wolverine', 'Wonder Woman', 'Thor', 'Super Man', 'Iron man']
    ['Naruto', 'Wolverine', 'Wonder Woman', 'Thor', 'Super Man', 'Iron man']

`index`

``` python
# Index of an object in the list.
# we use index method of the list.
# raises a ValueError, if no given object is found in the list.
try:
    print(my_list.index("Naruto"))
except ValueError as exc:
    print(f"Caught ValueError: {exc}")
```

``` 
5
```

`pop`

``` python
# Pop is used to remove and return the element present at the last in the list(index=-1) by default.
# When index argument is passed, it would remove and return the element at that index.
# raises IndexError when no object is present at the given Index.
try:
    last_element = (
        my_list.pop()
    )  # can be passed index argument value, if required to pop at a specific index.
    print(last_element)
except IndexError as exc:
    print(f"Caught IndexError: {exc}")
```

    Naruto

## Set

A set is collection of unique items, the items does not follow insertion
order.

Defining an set is pretty similar to a list or tuple, it is enclosed in
`{}`

PS üîî: If we need to have a empty set, `{}` won‚Äôt create a set, it
creates a empty dictionary instead. So we need to create a empty set by
using
`set()`

``` python
anime = {"Dragon ball", "One Piece", "Death Note", "Full Metal Alchemist", "Naruto"}
print(anime)
```

    {'Dragon ball', 'Full Metal Alchemist', 'One Piece', 'Naruto', 'Death Note'}

`add`

``` python
anime.add("Tokyo Ghoul")
print(anime)
```

    {'Dragon ball', 'Full Metal Alchemist', 'One Piece', 'Tokyo Ghoul', 'Naruto', 'Death Note'}

`remove`

remove method of set can be used to remove a particular object from the
set, if the object is not present, KeyError would be raised.

``` python
try:
    anime.remove("Tokyo Ghoul")
    print(anime)
except KeyError as exc:
    print(
        f"Caught KeyError as there's given anime series present in the anime set: {exc}"
    )
```

    {'Dragon ball', 'Full Metal Alchemist', 'One Piece', 'Naruto', 'Death Note'}

## Dictionary

As in few other languages, we have hashmaps, Dictionaries in python are
similar. It has unique Key - Value pairs.

The Key and Value can be of any object. Each Key-Value pair is separated
by a `,`

``` python
anime_protagonist = {
    "Dragon Ball": "Goku",
    "One Piece": "Luffy",
    "Death Note": "Yagami Light",
    "Full Metal Alchemist": "Edward Elric",
    "Naruto": "Naruto",
}
print(anime_protagonist)
```

    {'Dragon Ball': 'Goku', 'One Piece': 'Luffy', 'Death Note': 'Yagami Light', 'Full Metal Alchemist': 'Edward Elric', 'Naruto': 'Naruto'}

We can access the values of the dictionary by `<dictionary>[<key>]`. If
there‚Äôs no `<key>` in the dictionary, we would be seeing an KeyError üîë‚ùå

``` python
try:
    print(anime_protagonist["Dragon Ball"])
except KeyError as exc:
    print(
        f"üëª Ouch, Keyerror has been raised as no given key is found in the dictionary: {exc}"
    )
```

    Goku

Iterate over keys, values and both in the dictionary üêá

PS üîî: Are dictionaries ordered collectionü§î?

From Python 3.7 dictionaries follow insertion order üòé

In python versions older than 3.7, the insertion of items is not
orderedüôÑ. No problem üôÉ, we still have OrderedDict(present in
collections module) `from collections import OrderedDict` which does the
same üòâ

# 1.7 User Input

`input` is a builtin function in Python, which prompts for the user to
enter as standard input upto newline(`\n`).

`input` function always returns a string datatype, we need to typecast
to respective datatype required.

Python 2.x‚Äôs `input` is different from Python 3.x‚Äôs `input`.

Python 2.x‚Äôs `input` evaluates the string as a python command, like
`eval(input())`.

``` python
user_entered = input("Hey Pythonist! Please enter anything: \n>>>")
print(user_entered)
```

    Hey Pythonist! Please enter anything: 
    >>> Hello Python üêç
    
    
    Hello Python üêç

Let‚Äôs try typecasting to integers we got from the user.

If the input is not a valid integer value, typecasting to integer raises
`ValueError`

``` python
try:
    variable_1 = input("Enter variable 1 to be added: \n>>>")  # string
    variable_2 = input("Enter variable 2 to be added \n>>>")  # string
    integer_1 = int(variable_1)  # Typecasting to integer
    integer_2 = int(variable_2)  # Typecasting to integer
    print(f"sum of {variable_1} and {variable_2} = {integer_1+integer_2}")
except ValueError as exc:
    print(f"üëª unable to typecast to integer: {exc}")
```

    Enter variable 1 to be added: 
    >>> I am not an Integer üòú
    Enter variable 2 to be added 
    >>> I am not an Integer as well üòú
    
    
    üëª unable to typecast to integer: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'I am not an Integer üòú'

# 1.8 Builtins

``` python
import builtins
```

We can see what all builtins does Python provide.

For our sake, we are traversing the complete list and printing the
number and builtin attribute.

The function we are usign to traverse in `dir(builtins)` and get index
and builtin attribute is `enumerate` which is also a bulitin üòâ

``` python
for index, builtin_attribute in enumerate(dir(builtins)):
    print(f"{index}) {builtin_attribute}")

There‚Äôs a difference between **Keywords** and **Builtins** ü§î. We can‚Äôt
assign a new object to the Keywords, if we try to do, we would be seeing
an exception raised üî¥. But coming to builtins, we can assign any object
to the builtin names, and Python won‚Äôt have any issues, but it‚Äôs not a
good practice to do so üòá

# 1.9 Module

A module is a importable python file and can be created by creating a
file with extension as `.py`

We can import the objects present in the module.

In the below üëá example, we are importing `hello` function from `greet`
module (greet.py)

`greet.py`

``` python
"""Module to greet the user"""

import getpass


def hello():
    username: str = getpass.getuser().capitalize()
    print(f"Hello {username}. Have a great day :)")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

``` python
from greet import hello
```

``` python
hello()
```

    Hello Root. Have a great day :)

let‚Äôs have a look at the greet.py module. Well, we see the below `if`
condition.

``` python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

But why do we we need to have itü§î? We can just call the `hello` function
at the end as

``` python
hello()
```

Let‚Äôs see the belowüëá code to know why we use the first approach rather
than the second.üôÉ

``` python
import greet
```

üîç The above code doesn‚Äôt greet you üò¢

``` python
%run ./greet.py
```

    Hello Root. Have a great day :)

But, this above code greets youüòé.

The reason for this is, in the first snippet, we are importing a module
called `greet`, so the actual code we are executing is in this REPL or
Ipython shell.

Coming to second snippet, we are executing the `greet.py` directly.

Value of `__name__` would be ‚Äú\_\_main\_\_‚Äù if we are executing a Python
module directly. If we import a module(using the module indirectly) then
value of `__name__` would be the relative path of the imported module.
In the first example the `__name__` in the greet module would be
‚Äúgreet‚Äù. As the ‚Äúgreet‚Äù is not equal to ‚Äú\_\_main\_\_‚Äù, that‚Äôs the
reason, we never went to the `if` condition when we imported greet
module. üôÇ

# 1.10 String representations of objects: str() vs repr()

`str()` and `repr()` are builtin functions used to represent the object
in the form of string.

Suppose we have an object `x`.

`str(x)` would be calling the dunder (double underscore) `__str__`
method of `x` as `x.__str__()`

`repr(x)` would be calling the dunder (double underscore) `__repr__`
method of `x` as `x.__repr__()`

üòë Well, what all are these new terms `__str__` and `__repr__` ü§î?

As we know that Python is object oriented language, and so supports
inheritance. In Python, all the classes would inherit from the base
class `object`. `object` class has the methods `__str__`, `__repr__` and
a lot more (which can be deepdived in someother notebook üòâ). Hence every
class would be having `__str__` and `__repr__` implicitly üòä

Python‚Äôs official documentations states that `__str__` should be used to
represent a object which is human readable(informal), whereas `__repr__`
is used for official representation of an object.

``` python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()

print(f"The repr of now is: {repr(now)}")
print(f"The str of now is: {str(now)}")
```

    The repr of now is: datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 6, 4, 11, 4, 520866)
    The str of now is: 2021-06-06 04:11:04.520866

``` python
class ProgrammingLanguage:
    def __init__(self, language: str):
        self.language = language


language_obj = ProgrammingLanguage(language="Python")
print(f"The repr of language_obj is: {repr(language_obj)}")
print(f"The str of language_obj is: {str(language_obj)}")
```

    The repr of language_obj is: <__main__.ProgrammingLanguage object at 0x7f080861d9d0>
    The str of language_obj is: <__main__.ProgrammingLanguage object at 0x7f080861d9d0>

In the above example we see that default repr output. The address of the
object might be different for everyone.

Now let‚Äôs try to override the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and see
how the representations work

``` python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # overriding __str__ method
    def __str__(self):
        return f"I am {self.name} of age {self.age}"

    # overriding __repr__ method
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Human(name={self.name}, age={self.age}) object at {hex(id(self))}"


human_obj = Human(name="IronMan", age=48)
print(f"The repr of human_obj is: {repr(human_obj)}")
print(f"The str of human_obj is: {str(human_obj)}")
```

    The repr of human_obj is: Human(name=IronMan, age=48) object at 0x7f08085da040
    The str of human_obj is: I am IronMan of age 48

We see that the result representations of the `human_obj` have been
changed as we have overridden the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods üòä

# 1.11 Installing packages

Python has one of the largest programming community who build 3rd party
packages and support community help ‚ù§Ô∏è.

That‚Äôs pretty good, Now, how do we install the packages ü§î? We could use
Python‚Äôs package manager **PIP**.

Python‚Äôs official 3rd party package repository is [Python Package Index
(PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) and its index url is https://pypi.org/simple

Here‚Äôs how to use PIP in shell/terminal:

To search for a package:

``` shell
pip search [package name]
```

To install a package: Install

``` shell
    pip install [package name]
```

Install a specific version

``` shell
    pip install [package name]==[version]
```

Install greater than a specific version

``` shell
    pip install [package name]>=[verion]
```

To uninstall a package

``` shell
pip uninstall [package name]
```

## Tidbits üîî

There are modern ways of managing the dependencies using
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/),
[flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) etc.. We will
get to those soon‚Ä¶üòä

# 1.12 Help Utility

Python has a builtin help utility which helps to know about the
keywords, builtin functions, modules.

``` python
help()
```

You can pass keyword, bulitin function or Module to help function to
know about the same.

``` python
import os
```

``` python
# Help utility on the builtin module 'sys'
help(os)
```

*`snipped output:`*

``` shell

Help on module os:

NAME
    os - OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.

MODULE REFERENCE
    https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/os
    
    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.
```

``` python
# Help utility on getcwd function of sys module
help(os.getcwd)
```

    Help on built-in function getcwd in module posix:
    
    getcwd()
        Return a unicode string representing the current working directory.

üîî Help function returns the docstrings associated with the respective
Modules, Keywords or functions.

# 2.1 Indendation

I have seen memes of people fighting about opening braces, whether they
should be starting in the same line or in next line in the programming
languages like C, Java etc‚Ä¶ üëª

![Types of using curly
braces](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/Temporary-host-store/blob/main/Chapters_1-5/Chapter_2/resources/type_of_using_curly_braces.jpg?raw=true)

**Python Developers be like:** Hold my Beer üç∫

![Python developers: we don‚Äôt do that
here](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/Temporary-host-store/blob/main/Chapters_1-5/Chapter_2/resources/curly_braces_we_dont_do_that_here.jpg?raw=true)

In Python, we don‚Äôt use curly braces for grouping the statements.
Instead, we use Indendation.

Each group of statements are indended using spaces or tabs.

``` python
class Example:
    # Every method belonging to a class must be indended equally.
    def __init__(self):
        name = "indendation example"

    def check_for_odd_or_even(self, number: int):
        # Everything that belongs to this method are indended as well.
        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{number} is even.")
        else:
            print(f"{number} is odd.")


# We can see that the say_hello_multiple_times is not indended inside the Example class.
# Hence, say_hello_multiple_times function doesn't belong to Example class.
def say_hello_multiple_times(count: int):
    for _ in range(count):
        # Loops or conditions are also needed to be intended.
        print("Hello")
```

[PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) recommends to use **4
Spaces instead of Tabs**. Although using of Tabs do work, but ensure
**not** to mix both tabs and spaces, as you might get `TabError` for
such indendations.

### A meme on indendation üòú

If using a normal text editor like notepad where it doesn‚Äôt show the
warnings or errors, sometimes we might get errors due to wrong
indendation or mix usage of both tabs and spaces, we get an error and it
would be tricky to resolve it as it is invisible.

space](https://github.com/NaveenKumarReddy8/Temporary-host-store/blob/main/Chapters_1-5/Chapter_2/resources/funny_get_errors_for_extra_space.jpg?raw=true)

# 3.1 Comments and Docstrings

Comments are used to explain the code. The interpreter doesn‚Äôt execute
the comments. There are 3 types of comments in Python:

  - Single Line
  - In-Line
  - Multi Line

## Single Line

Single line comments are written in a single line. Single line comments
start with `#`

``` python
# Here's a single line comment
```

## In-Line

In-Line comments are written beside the code.

``` python
print("Hello")  # Here's a In-Line comment
```

## Multi Line

Sometimes we need to write a huge explanation using comments, in those
cases we do use multi-line comments. multiline comments are enclosed in
`""" """` or `''' '''`

``` python
"""
Here's a 
multiline comment.
"""
```

## Docstrings

Docstrings are specific type of comments that are stored as a attribute
to the module, class, method or function.

Docstrings are written similar to the multi-line comments using `"""
"""` or `''' '''`, the only difference would be they are written exactly
at the start(first statement) of the module, class, method or function.

Docstrings can be programatically acccessed using the `__doc__` method
or through the built-in function `help`. Let‚Äôs give a try üòé.

``` python
def double_the_value(value: int):
    """Doubles the integer value passed to the function and returns it."""
    return value * 2
```

### Using help

`help` function provides the docstrings as well as the information about
the module, class, method or function.

``` python
help(double_the_value)
```

    Help on function double_the_value in module __main__:
    
    double_the_value(value: int)
        Doubles the integer value passed to the function and returns it.

### Using `__doc__`

``` python
print(double_the_value.__doc__)
```

    Doubles the integer value passed to the function and returns it.

Can we use the single line comments instead of multi-line docstrings ü§î?
Let‚Äôs try this as well.

``` python
def test_single_line_comment_as_docstring():
    # This is a single-line comment
    pass
```

``` python
print(test_single_line_comment_as_docstring.__doc__)
```

    None

We can see that `None` is printed, which explains that we can‚Äôt use
single-line comments as docstrings üôÇ

## Docstrings for documentation of code.

[PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) defines two types
of docstrings.

  - One-Line docstring
  - Multi-Line
docstring

### [One-Line docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings)

One-line docstrings are suited for short and simple Modules, classes,
methods or functions.

``` python
def one_line_docstring():
    """This is a one-line docstring"""
    pass
```

### [Multi-Line docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings)

Multi-line docstrings are suited for long, complex Modules, classes,
methods or functions

``` python
def multi_line_docstring(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> None:
    """
    This is a multi-line docstring.

    Arguments:
      arg1 (int): Argument 1 is an integer.
      arg2 (str): Argument 2 is a string.
    """
    pass
```

## Styles of docstrings

There are multiple styles of writing docstrings such as
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), [Google
Python Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings),
[Numpy
style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

We could use any of the above docstrings style as long as we stay
consistent.

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a tool that generated
beautiful HTML based documentation üìú from the docstrings we provide in
our code. reStructuredText is the default style, for other styles like
Google Python style, numpy we could use plugins like
[Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html).

Sphinx also provides various templates we can choose from to create the
HTML documentation out of it.
